In addition, disclosure to contact@potatoswap.finance must be made promptly following discovery of the vulnerability. Please include as much information about the vulnerability as possible, including:

A detailed report of a vulnerability increases the likelihood of a reward and may increase the reward amount.

Anyone who reports a unique, previously-unreported vulnerability that results in a change to the code or a configuration change and who keeps such vulnerability confidential until it has been resolved by our engineers will be recognized publicly for their contribution, if agreed.
